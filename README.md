# suicide_rates_visualization
Explored data from Kaggle's "Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016" (https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016). Using Tableau, visualized the oncoming mental health crisis with the newer generations escalating proportion of suicides.
A disparity can be seen both between suicides by gender and by country of origin, with males and more developed countries at higher risk.
Missing reports of suicides in later years create a false downwards trend, but the overall implication of what is seen is an exer growing crisis.
Powerpoint is limited presentation of data.
